 Profile
I'm a Quantitative Ecologist at The Peregrine Fund and part of the Global Raptor Impact Network (GRIN). My research interests include conservation biology, population ecology, ornithology, and statistics. I work for our main office in Boise, Idaho USA, but I reside in Cheticamp, NS Canada. You'll find lots of Bayesian stats in my repositories, focusing on habitat associations and population trends of birds.
